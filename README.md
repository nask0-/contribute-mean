TODOs:


Rating system (e.g. 5 stars - each star increases the total score by say 10%) -- 
  -- Added the Front-end side, now do the db logic like:
      
      Get current user, selected contribution and rating given, then
        If rating not given by user already, insert User - Rating pair to contribution; augment contribution score
        Else update User - Rating pair; augment contribution score;


* Admin Tagging (e.g. if Kevin, aka the boss, thinks we under/over-rate a task)


Change Log:
Tables now show Impact Score
Tables can be sorted (Asc/Descending) on multiple columns
